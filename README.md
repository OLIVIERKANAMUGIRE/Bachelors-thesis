Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) provide the ability to understand how natural phenomena evolve with respect to changes in the various factors on which such phenomena depend. 
Famous equations such as the heat equation, which describes how heat propagates, and the wave equation, as well as the Schr¨odinger equation, which describes how the quantum state 
of a physical system changes over time, have been studied; however, there is still a shortage of complexity in analyzing such systems. The goal of this research project is to solve 
the initial boundary value problem of the wave equation in its linear form using generalized functions. A specific emphasis is placed on the treatment and generalization of initial
and boundary data because this is an essential aspect that boosts the applicability and versatility of solutions to the wave equation. By solving and analyzing initial boundary value
problems in one dimension (d’Alembert formula) and two dimensions (Poisson formula) through the use of generalized functions, the unique characteristics and properties inherent in the
solutions show that they can be generalized to n dimensions and used to solve specific problems governed by the wave equation. Keywords: PDEs, Generalized Functions, Wave Equation, Initial boundary problem, Fourier Transform.
